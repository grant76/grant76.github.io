## Sleep Sound


### Project Topic

The impact of sound on sleep.

### Proposal Abstract 

Most adults require seven to nine hours of sleep a day in order to properly function and be alert the very next day. The problem is that according to the CDC, a third of US adults reported getting less than the recommended amount of sleep. Sleep deprivation is linked to chronic diseases and conditions as well as mistakes both small and large. There are many factors that can lead to sleep deprivation, both internal and external factors, but it is difficult to pinpoint the exact cause. The focus of our project is to tackle a very trivial, but common factor that affects everyone - the environment, more specifically sound. Most people can agree that a silent environment is the best environment to sleep in, but the problem is not every environment can be silent. Environmental noise is tough to block out no matter how quiet or loud it can be, especially if the sound is intermittent, so our focus isn’t to try to block it out, but use it to our advantage instead. Studies have shown that sound machines, like those that produce white noise, help people sleep better by moderating intermittent noise levels and providing a constant source of sound for a more peaceful and well-rested sleep. 

To determine which noise is optimal for sleep we will use a neural network. This network will use data inputs such as noise magnitude and frequency, movement of the individual, and time to fall asleep to track sleep quality.  It will have control over a noise generator to change the types of ambient sound throughout the night.  This data will give us insight into sound’s impact on sleep.
